# Instagram Clone in React Native

This is a sample Instagram clone built using React Native. It mimics the basic functionality of the Instagram app, allowing users to scroll through a feed of articles, view stories, like posts, leave comments, and more.

## Features

- **Feed**: Scroll through a feed of articles, each containing an image, user avatar, username, likes count, and comment count.
- **Stories**: View stories at the top of the feed. Stories include user avatars and usernames.
- **Interactivity**: Like posts by tapping the heart icon, leave comments by tapping the comment icon, and view comments by tapping on the comment count.
- **Camera Integration** (commented out in the code): The app includes a button to access the camera, allowing users to take photos directly within the app.
